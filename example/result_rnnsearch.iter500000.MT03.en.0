research shows that father of a child may have a bearing on the birth of a child .
( agence france-presse , paris , 28 ) ) in accordance with a danish study report which will be published last saturday , the father 's genes may affect the period of birth of children .
about five per cent of the pregnant women will be in the evening , and that is the time of pregnancy .
it is now known that this problem will pose a health problem to the mothers and children , but the causes of that are still a mystery .
in the period between 1980 and 1992 , the number of mothers who were born in UNK was at least two children , and they were in the middle of the first time .
the analysis used is only information on the production of the former two times .

however , when the first and second children came from their parents , the ratio would be slightly over 15 % .
UNK told afp , " this is already a lot of things .

the study report says : " if a woman changes his partner in a pregnancy , it will be able to reduce the risk of repeated UNK .
we believe that this is a new idea .
this result implies that the time of birth is likely to be a genetic decision of the father . "
